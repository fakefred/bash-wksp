MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY.

BY KARL MARX AND FREDERICK ENGELS.

A specter is haunting Europe â€” the specter of Communism. All the powers of
old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter;
Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police
spies.

Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic
by its opponents in power? Where the opposition that has not hurled back
the branding reproach of Communism, against the more advanced opposition
parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?

Two things result from this fact.

I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in
itself a power.

II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the
whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet
this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the
party itself.

To this end the Communists of various nationalities have assembled in
London, and sketched the following manifesto to be published in the
English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
